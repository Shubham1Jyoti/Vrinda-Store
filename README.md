I have created a dashboard for Vrinda Store 2023 in Excel 2007. 

𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬: 𝐌𝐞𝐧 𝐯𝐬 𝐖𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐧 - Women have done more shopping.

𝐁𝐨𝐭𝐭𝐨𝐦 5 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐬 - New Delhi, Mizoram, Ladakh, Dadar & Nagar, Meghalaya.

𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐡: 𝐎𝐫𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐯𝐬 𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬 - Highest sales done in the month of March and least in November.
The highest orders are done in the month of March and the least in November.

𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐥 𝐯𝐬 𝐎𝐫𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬- Most orders were done by Amazon and least by Others.

𝐎𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬 -Women, especially adult women, account for 60% of sales and orders, suggesting targeted marketing could drive further growth. March saw a 25% increase in sales and orders, indicating effective seasonal strategies, while Amazon contributed to 40% of total orders, emphasizing the need to strengthen this partnership. Low-performing regions like New Delhi and Mizoram, with sales 50% below average, present opportunities for market expansion.
